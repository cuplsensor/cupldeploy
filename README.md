# cupldeploy

Deploys a system made up of:

* A web application comprised of [cuplfrontend](https://github.com/cuplsensor/cuplfrontend) and [cuplbackend](https://github.com/cuplsensor/cuplbackend).
* [cuplTag](https://github.com/cuplsensor/cupltag) hardware and firmware.

## System Diagram 

![Diagram showing cuplfrontend cuplbackend and the database](docs/cupldeploy_system_diagram.png)

DNAME is short for DEPLOYMENT NAME `d3` or `latest`

### Frontend Diagram

Scanning cuplTag with an NFC phone causes the frontend web application to open. 

The application is hosted at a domain, for example: [latest.f.cupl.uk](https://latest.f.cupl.uk) and registered to the [Amazon Route53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/route53/?id=docs_gateway) DNS server. 

An **A Record** routes traffic to a [Amazon CloudFront distribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-working-with.html). CloudFront is a [Content Delivery Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network), which stores copies of **files** from a given **origin** at edge locations worldwide. 

* The files are a production optimized build of the **cuplfrontend** [static web application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page). 
* The origin is an [Amazon S3 Bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), a *pay-for-what-you-use* web folder with near infinite capacity.

CloudFront reduces latency in file access, compared to just hosting from S3. It is also easy to add an Amazon-provided SSL certificate, by [requesting one](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/install-ssl-cloudfront/) in Amazon Certificate Manager. The frontend should be served over HTTPS in a production environment. 

The frontend web application provides a Graphical User Interface to **cuplbackend**. Data are stored and retrieved via calls to its web-based API.

### Backend Diagram

The backend web application is hosted at a domain name, for example: [latest.b.cupl.uk](https://latest.b.cupl.uk). 

The domain is registered with the DigitalOcean DNS server. An **A record** routes traffic to the IP address of a DigitalOcean Droplet, which is a virtual machine running Linux. 

Services are packaged into [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)) containers. This is done for isolation: one service is not able to interfere with another. Each *sees* its own Linux installation and has to install its own dependencies, thereby avoiding [dependency hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell). 

The 3 services run on a single Docker instance using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).  Each is defined in [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml):

1. [Nginx-certbot](https://hub.docker.com/r/staticfloat/nginx-certbot/) runs the web server, **Nginx**. This acts as a *reverse proxy*. It rewrites requests received over TCP/IP into the [WSGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface) protocol, which is standard for Python web applications.
2. The [cuplbackend](https://hub.docker.com/r/cupl/backend) web application. It is built atop of the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) framework. The application exposes [two HTTPS APIs](https://cupl.readthedocs.io/projects/backend/en/latest/docs/api/index.html). The interface is text only: data are read and written as [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON). Data are persisted in an external PostgreSQL database.
3. A [Redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis) instance. A cuplbackend dependency named [Flask-Limiter](https://flask-limiter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) uses this to record and block API requests. 

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

1. A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
2. A [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) account. 
3. An [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) account. 

### Outputs

This tutorial demonstrates how to run the cupl web application, which consists of a [frontend](https://github.com/cuplsensor/cuplfrontend) and a [backend](https://github.com/cuplsensor/cuplbackend). This will be set up on your own infrastructure, accessible from a  [``ROOT_DOMAIN``](https://moz.com/blog/understanding-root-domains-subdomains-vs-subfolders-microsites) of your choice. 

The frontend and backend are hosted on separate subdomains.

Multiple instances, or deployments, of the web application can share a ``ROOT_DOMAIN``. These can run different application [versions](https://github.com/cuplsensor/cupldeploy/commits/main).  

Each deployment has a ``DEPLOY_NAME``:

* A test deployment (required). 
  ``DEPLOY_NAME = latest``
* Production deployment (optional). These are named `dX` where X is any integer.
  *example* ``DEPLOY_NAME = d3``

### Installation

#### Backend

##### Create the Backend Droplet

This part of the tutorial is derived from an [article](https://danielwachtel.com/devops/deploying-multiple-dockerized-apps-digitalocean-docker-compose-contexts) by Daniel Wachtel.

###### Start Droplet Specification

1. Sign into [DigitalOcean](https://cloud.digitalocean.com). 
2. Select [Droplets](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets) from the left menu.
3. Select **Create Droplet**.
4. Select a datacenter (*example* San Francisco 3). 
5. Keep the defaults:
   * Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS) x64.
   * Basic Shared CPU.
   * Regular Intel with 2GB of RAM.
     ![image-20210727215012705](docs/screenshots/image-20210727215012705.png)
6. The **monitoring** add-on is recommended.
7. Under **Authentication** select **SSH keys**.
8. Select **New SSH Key**
9. The **Add public SSH key** popup will open.

###### Create an SSH Key Pair for the Root User

1. Open a Bash shell on your local machine.
2. Run ``cd ~/.ssh``
3. Run ``ssh-keygen``.
   <img src="docs/screenshots/image-20210727230015823.png" width="100">
4. Name your keypair ``DEPLOY_NAME-ROOT_DOMAIN-root``  (*example* ``latest-lpuc-root``).
5. Enter a passphrase. 
6. Press ENTER and the key pair (a public and private key) will be generated. 

###### Copy the Public Key to the Droplet

1. Run  ``cat DEPLOY_NAME-ROOT_DOMAIN-root.pub`` (*example* ``cat latest-lpuc-root.pub``) to display the public key.
2. Copy the public key.
3. Paste it into the **SSH key content** box, which is in the **Add public SSH key** popup.
   ![image-20210727222512067](docs/screenshots/image-20210727222512067.png)
4. Enter ``DEPLOY_NAME-ROOT_DOMAIN-root`` (*example* ``latest-lpuc-root``) as the **Name**.
5. Click **Add SSH Key**.

###### Back up the Private Key

*Recommendation:* store the private key and the passphrase in a secure location, such as a password manager. If you lose these credentials, you will lose root access to your droplet, which is needed to install security updates. The private key can be seen by entering ``cat DEPLOY_NAME-ROOT_DOMAIN-root`` without the .pub suffix.

###### Finalize Droplet Specification

1. Under **Choose a hostname** enter ``cupldeploy-DEPLOY_NAME-ROOT_DOMAIN`` (*example* ``cupldeploy-latest-lpuc``).
2. Select **Create Droplet**.
3. Wait for the Droplet to be created.
4. Note the IPV4 address of your droplet in the top-left corner as ``BACKEND_DROPLET_IPV4`` (highlighted in yellow).
   ![image-20210727225556294](docs/screenshots/image-20210727225556294.png)

##### Install NGINX Web Server on the Droplet

NGINX is installed here for test purposes and removed later. The test web page *Welcome to NGINX!* shows your droplet (and later your DNS) is running ok.

The following steps assume the droplet private key is located in the `~/.ssh` folder on your local machine.

1. Open a Bash shell.
2. Type ``ssh root@BACKEND_DROPLET_IPV4`` (*example* ``ssh root@147.182.201.13``)
3. Enter the private key passphrase.
4. You will be logged into the droplet as root.
5. Run ``apt-get install nginx`` 
   ![image-20210727233426171](docs/screenshots/image-20210727233426171.png)

###### Test the Web Server

1. Open a web browser.
2. Enter ``http://BACKEND_DROPLET_IPV4`` in the address bar. You must use HTTP, because HTTPS has not been set up yet.
3. Expect to see the test page.
   ![image-20210726102345924](docs/screenshots/image-20210726102345924.png)

##### Register your Root Domain

1. Sign into [Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/) using your AWS account.

2. In the Register domain section, find and buy your choice of ``ROOT_DOMAIN``.
   ![image-20210725185842549](docs/screenshots/image-20210725185842549.png)

3. Wait for domain name registration to complete.

   ![image-20210725190438608](docs/screenshots/image-20210725190438608.png)

##### Add an A Record for the Droplet

<a name="latest_droplet_host"></a>
The backend web application should be accessible from a domain name and not just an IP address. 

This will be referred to as: ``LATEST_DROPLET_HOST = latest.b.ROOT_DOMAIN`` (*example* ``latest.b.lpuc.uk``)

An [A record](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/a-record/#whats-an-a-record) points ``LATEST_DROPLET_HOST`` to your web server at ``BACKEND_DROPLET_IPV4``.

1. Sign into [Amazon Route 53](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53) using your AWS account.

2. Select Hosted Zones. 

3. Select the ``ROOT_DOMAIN`` you created in the previous step. This hosted zone was created automatically in the previous step.
   ![image-20210731143437729](docs/screenshots/image-20210731143437729.png)

4. You will see 2 records: NS and SOA. Select **Create Record** in the top left. 
   ![image-20210731145258815](docs/screenshots/image-20210731145258815.png)

5. Under **Record name** enter ``latest.b``

6. Under **Value** enter ``BACKEND_DROPLET_IPV4`` (*example* 147.182.201.13).

7. Change **TTL (seconds)** to 60.

8. Select **Create records**.

   ![image-20210731150311222](docs/screenshots/image-20210731150311222.png)

9. The newly created A record will show in the list. Wait at least 60 seconds for the DNS change to propagate. 

###### Test the A Record

1. Open a web browser.
2. Enter ``http://LATEST_DROPLET_HOST`` in the address bar. You must use HTTP, because HTTPS has not been set up yet.
3. Expect to see the test page.
   ![image-20210726101734391](docs/screenshots/image-20210726101734391.png)

##### Remove NGINX from the Droplet

NGINX is no longer needed, so uninstall it from your droplet. Instructions are similar to those used for installation.

1. Open a Bash shell on your local machine.
2. Type ``ssh root@BACKEND_DROPLET_IPV4`` (*example* ``ssh root@147.182.201.13``)
3. Enter the private key passphrase.
4. You will be logged into the droplet as root.
5. Run ``apt-get remove nginx nginx-common``, then ``Y`` to confirm.
6. The server still runs after removal. Run ``killall nginx`` to stop it. 

##### Install Docker on the Droplet

Whilst still connected to the droplet as ``root``, [install the latest version of docker using the repository](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository).

##### Install Docker-Compose on the Droplet

The [GitHub Actions Runner](https://github.com/cuplsensor/cupldeploy/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml) uses the [Docker Contexts](https://www.docker.com/blog/how-to-deploy-on-remote-docker-hosts-with-docker-compose/) feature to deploy containers onto the (remote) droplet. 

Both the runner and droplet must run the same version of docker-compose. A mismatch can cause container deployments to fail. 

As of writing, cupldeploy supports docker-compose version 1.27.4. To install this on your droplet, run the following as ``root``:

```bash
curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.27.4/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

When finished, run ``docker-compose -v``.

Expect to see:
![image-20210731190025294](docs/screenshots/image-20210731190025294.png)

##### Add a Non-root User to the Droplet

<a name="latest_droplet_username"></a>

The cupldeploy GitHub Actions script signs into the droplet ``cupldeploy-latest-lpuc`` as a non-root user: ``LATEST_DROPLET_USERNAME``. 

In this tutorial, ``LATEST_DROPLET_USERNAME = deployer``. 

1. Open an SSH connection to your droplet as ``root`` (if this is not already open).
2. Run ``adduser deployer``.
3. Set a long password of your choice.
4. Remove the need to be ``sudo`` in order to run docker ([source](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)) 
   1. Run ``sudo groupadd docker``.
   2. Run ``sudo usermod -aG docker deployer``.

##### Create an SSH key pair for ``deployer``

This should be done on your local machine. Do not create the key pair on the droplet. 

1. Open a Bash shell on your local machine.
2. Run ``ssh-keygen`` to create an SSH keypair for the deployer user.
3. Name your keypair ``DEPLOY_NAME-ROOT_DOMAIN-deployer``  (*example* ``latest-lpuc-deployer``).
4. *Do not* create a passphrase for this key pair.

###### Copy the Public Key for ``deployer`` to the Droplet

The script below is thanks to [Michael Wyraz](https://superuser.com/a/978182). Modify it according to your needs and run on your local machine. It:

1. Makes an SSH connection from your local machine to the droplet as ``root``.
2. Copies the SSH public key file (stored locally as ``latest-lpuc-deployer.pub``) into the ``authorized_keys`` file for the droplet user ``deployer``.  

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/latest-lpuc-deployer.pub | ssh root@latest.b.lpuc.uk "sudo mkdir /home/deployer/.ssh; sudo tee -a /home/deployer/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

###### Save the Private Key for Later

View the private key by entering ``cat DEPLOY_NAME-ROOT_DOMAIN-deployer`` (*example* ``latest-lpuc-deployer``).

From now on, this will be known as <a name="latest_droplet_ssh_private_key"></a>``LATEST_DROPLET_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY``. Save it to your password manager.

###### Test the SSH Connection

This step verifies that you can use SSH to connect to the backend droplet as ``deployer``.

1. Open a Bash shell on your local machine.
2. Run ``ssh deployer@LATEST_DROPLET_HOST`` (*example* ``ssh deployer@latest.b.lpuc.uk``).
3. Expect the SSH connection to open successfully.
   ![image-20210731181722965](docs/screenshots/image-20210731181722965.png)

#### Database

The backend web application stores data in a Postgres 11 database. You can use any provider. The required by cupldeploy are:

``DB_USER`` Database username.

``DB_PASS`` Database password.

---

``DB_HOST`` Database host name or IP address.

``DB_PORT`` Database port number.

---

``LATEST_DB_NAME`` Database name.

---

These are used by [config.py](https://github.com/cuplsensor/cuplbackend/blob/30fa7eac1b4158d7811665f7389c20a279e2faed/backendapp/config.py) to construct a connection string in the format

```
postgresql://DB_USER:DB_PASS@DB_HOST:DB_PORT/LATEST_DB_NAME
```

---

A managed solution with automatic backups is recommended for production. 

There are benefits to co-locating your database server with the backend application server (droplet):

- Reduced latency.
- Improved security. The DB server can communicate over a private network ([VPC](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/vpc/)). There is no need to expose it to the internet.

##### Create a DigitalOcean Database

In this tutorial, we will set up a DigitalOcean managed database in the same datacenter that hosts our droplet. 

1. Sign into [DigitalOcean](https://cloud.digitalocean.com). 
2. Select [Databases](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/databases) from the left menu.
3. Select **Create a Database Cluster**.
4. Under **Choose a database engine** select **PostgreSQL version 11**.
5. The default cluster configuration will work.
6. Select the same datacenter that your droplet is in (*example* San Francisco 3). 
   ![image-20210801131134395](docs/screenshots/image-20210801131134395.png | width=100)
7. Under **Choose a unique database cluster name** enter ``db-postgresql-DATACENTER-ROOT_DOMAIN`` (*example* ``db-postgresql-sfo3-lpuc``).
8. Select the green **Create a Database Cluster** button.
9. You will enter the getting started step-by-step, whilst the database is provisioned. Click **Get Started**.
10. Under **Add trusted sources** enter the name of your droplet. 
    ![image-20210801132313788](docs/screenshots/image-20210801132313788.png | width=100)
11. Select **Allow these inbound sources only**.
12. Select **Continue, I'll do this later** followed by **Great, I'm done**.
13. From the top menu, select **Users & Databases**.
14. Under **Add new user** enter ``deployer`` followed by **Save**.
15. Under **Add new database** enter ``latest-lpuc-db`` followed by **Save**. An empty database will be created.
    ![image-20210801133623482](docs/screenshots/image-20210801133623482.png | width=100)
16. Finally we will note our database credentials. From the top menu, select **Overview**.
17. Under **Connection Details** select **VPC network**.
18. Under **User** select ``deployer``.
19. Under **Database/Pool** select ``latest-lpuc-db``.
    ![image-20210801134904372](docs/screenshots/image-20210801134904372.png | width=100)
20. Record the following:

| Variable Name                            | Connection Details Name | Example                                |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| <a name="db_user"></a>``DB_USER``        | ``username``            | ``deployer``                           |
| <a name="db_pass"></a>``DB_PASS``        | ``password``            | click **show** to reveal               |
| <a name="db_host"></a>``DB_HOST``        | ``host``                | ``private-db-***-.ondigitalocean.com`` |
| <a name="db_port"></a>``DB_PORT``        | ``port``                | ``25060``                              |
| <a name="db_name"></a>``LATEST_DB_NAME`` | ``database``            | ``latest-lpuc-db``                     |
| <a name="db_sslmode"></a>``DB_SSLMODE``  | ``sslmode``             | ``require``                            |

#### Run cupldeploy

##### Fork the Git Repository

1. Navigate to [https://github.com/cuplsensor/cupldeploy](https://github.com/cuplsensor/cupldeploy).

2. Sign into GitHub.

3. Select the **Fork** button in the top-right corner.
   ![image-20210801150235279](docs/screenshots/image-20210801150235279.png)

4. The forked repository will open.
   ![image-20210801150823478](docs/screenshots/image-20210801150823478.png)

##### Define GitHub Secrets

[GitHub Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) are a means of providing sensitive strings to [Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) scripts. Similar to environment variables, these must be defined for your forked repository for Actions to run successfully. Secrets ensure that sensitive data are not stored in the GitHub repository itself.

1. Select **Settings** from the top menu.

2. Select **Secrets** from the left submenu.

3. Select the **New repository secret** button.

   ![image-20210801153144869](docs/screenshots/image-20210801153144869.png)

4. Under **Name** enter ``DB_HOST``.

5. Under **Value** enter the database host name recorded [earlier](#db_host).

6. Repeat steps 3 to 6 until all of the following are defined:


| Name                               | Value                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| ``DB_USER``                        | [link](#db_user)                        |
| ``DB_PASS``                        | [link](#db_password)                    |
| ``DB_HOST``                        | [link](#db_host)                        |
| ``DB_PORT``                        | [link](#db_password)                    |
| ``LATEST_DB_NAME``                 | [link](#db_name)                        |
| ``DB_SSLMODE``                     | [link](#db_sslmode)                     |
| ``LATEST_DROPLET_USERNAME``        | [link](#latest_droplet_username)        |
| ``LATEST_DROPLET_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`` | [link](#latest_droplet_ssh_private_key) |

| ``LATEST_ADMINAPI_CLIENTSECRET``   | \*** random string ***                  |
| ``LATEST_TAGTOKEN_CLIENTSECRET``   | \*** random string \***                 |
| ``LATEST_HASHIDS_SALT``            | \*** random string \***                 |
| ``LATEST_CSRF_SESSION_KEY``        | \*** random string \***                 |
| ``LATEST_SECRET_KEY``              | \*** random string \***                 |

*Recommendation:* Save all secrets in a password manager. These will not be readable again on GitHub.

*Recommendation:* Random strings should be at least 20 characters in length, mixed case and contain letters, symbols and numbers.
